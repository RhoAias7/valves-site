When I joined the band I originally wanted to do vocals but the lads didn't really need an extra singer. So Glenn and Jake gave me a bass guitar, which I had never played before! They told me that I was now the bass player of the band. At first I was hesitant but now I love it and nothing beats the feeling of being up on stage and just grooving to the music. So to answer your question.. 2 years!"</p>

I had my first drum lesson when I was 9 and the next day I bought my very first drum kit with the last â‚¬100 of my Communion money."<br><em id="intq">Who are your musical influences?</em> "I've always seemed to listen to music where the drums are very noticible and loud! So I would find myself listening to a lot of alt rock and punk rock so a lot of bands like Blink 182, Green Day, Foo Fighters, Royal Blood, The Kaiser Chiefs, Led Zeppelin and also a lot drum & bass music"</p>
